#Description

As part of the UCF coding bootcamp homework for week 4, the code quiz was designed to test your genius in the realm of syntax and divs. Do you have what it takes?

To begin, simply launch the page and click on the green **"Whatever it takes"** button. This will begin the quiz. You will have **60** seconds to complete the quiz from the time you click the button. But beware, this quiz is not for the faint of heart. For every question you get wrong, you lose 15 seconds off the clock. Run out of time, and you'll be trembeling in the wits of those who keep you down.

Feeling vengeful? Check out the highscores tab and dethrone your mother in law from the top of the score board to send her a message that you didnt come this far to wipe noses. So come on, give it a shot. Genius runs in the family, right?

#  Technologies

This quiz was coded using HTML, CSS, and JS.

# Challenges

Believe you me, one of the hardest parts of this project was trying to get everything lined up on the webpage, especially the alignment of the card. I tried bootstraps very own jumbotron. I tired cards, good ol containers and even tried to implement a progress bar at some point instead of the seconds counting down. A friend of mine was successfull in that remark but I decided it wasnt worth the hassle.
